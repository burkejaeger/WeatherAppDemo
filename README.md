# Starter Pack - Jaeger

*The environment I set up is a web dev “starter pack” I can use as a launch point for other future projects. It assumes a base of an HTML website with JS functionality as the base for the project. It also contains a folder for Node packages, and Node Package Manager is installed with basic build, start, and test scripts.

It contains a /src directory which includes a basic index.html “Loading” file which also displays the site logo image, as well as a style.scss file linked to this HTML file. There is also a basic index.js file with ES6 syntax, which modifies the webpage text to include an incrementing counter of how many seconds the page has been open. Additionally, the src directory contains an images directory which holds the site logo and any other necessary images.

Webpack is the configured build tool with a basic webpack.config.json file. Webpack is configured with plugins for HTML, ESLint, and CSS. ESLint is configured as the chosen product for linting, and Babel is configured as the JavaScript interpreter. Hot Reload and Auto-Prefixing are also enabled.

This “Starter Pack” is to be used as a base for future projects and coursework.*

## What Worked Well

The Linter worked particularly well and corrected all syntax errors in my javascript file (there were originally very many). Getting the context from this assignment by working on it before I have completed Lab 2 is also helpful because it gives me some useful tools I can use to complete Lab 2 and other assignments effectively. The Hot Reload was very helpful and decreased the amount of time I have to spend closing and reloading the project while I work to see changes instantaneously.

## What Didn't

I have never coded in JavaScript before, so writing my first function to increment the seconds counter on the website was a fun exercise! I found it somewhat challenging to learn the new syntax, but luckily ESLint helped me fix small errors once I had gotten the functionality in place.
